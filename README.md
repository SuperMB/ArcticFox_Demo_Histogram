This repo provides the code that follows the Histogram example for Arctic Fox. This code will demonstrate we use Arctic Fox even for the samll things such as finite state machines and memory interfaces. I can't recount how many small mistakes we've avoided by automating these components. This example was put together to give a quick introduction to Arctic Fox.
